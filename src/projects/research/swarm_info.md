## Foraging Swarm Robotics

Conducted research in Swarm Robotics under PhD student John Harwell and Professor Maria Gini. The focus of the research is maximizing energy efficiency in large swarms of small robots in various environmental scenarios. In this research we present an energy efficiency maximization method that minimizes the overall energy cost within a swarm while simultaneously maximizing swarm performance on an object gathering task.
A simulation is coded up with the new swarm robotics strategy through a program called ARGoS.
Paper was accepted in the ARMS workshop at the AAMAS 2019 Conference in Montreal, CA.
