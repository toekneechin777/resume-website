## TYBALT: Transcending cYber Barriers with Automated Language Tracking

During my internship with Smart Information Flow Technologies (SIFT), I was able to work on a DARPA project called TYBALT related to identifying aggressive/harmful behavior in language.

TYBALT is a Ph 2 SBIR under the “Force Protection in the Online Information Environment” topic with the objective to use Publicly Available Information (PAI) to detect intent to harm U.S. forces in foreign populations. Under TYBALT, we apply and scale social science theory to inform the development of an Intention-To-Act-Adversely Detector (ITAAD). In particular we use social science theories, e.g. Moral Disengagement (MD) (Bandura) and Integrative Complexity (IC) (Suedfeld) to identify harmful or aggressive behavior in language. This effort integrates with ongoing cyber threats to deliberately manipulate the online content to influence human decision making.

One of the approaches to this included performing NLP sentence classification and sentiment analysis on internet comments including those made by a misogynistic, violent, and extremist online subculture such as incels.
