## Provider Fraud Detection Using Graph Databases & Image Recognition

Over my summer internship at Optum as an AI/ML Research Intern, my team was given the task of finding a way to detect health insurance provider fraud through Neo4j Graph Databases with graph algorithms and social network analysis. The results are ranked in a table modeled under semi-supervised learning. I also took the liberty of adding a computer vision component to our fraud detection which has impressed the higher-ups at Optum to try to pursue a patent review.
