## Relating Gender Bias, Gender Values, and Gender Gaps

This research extends the previous work done on "Quantifying Gender Bias on Twitter". This research not only presents an approach to (1) quantify gender bias in word embeddings (i.e., vector-based lexical semantics),(2) correlate gender biases with survey responses and statistical gender gaps in education, politics, economics, and health but also to (3) integrate numerical biases and statistics to model different cultures’ survey results more accurately than either in isolation. We validate this approach using 2018 Twitter  data  spanning  99 countries, 18 Global Gender Gap statistics from the World Economic Forum, and 8 international survey results from the World  Value Survey. Integrating these heterogeneous data across cultures is an important step toward building computational models to understand group bias.
