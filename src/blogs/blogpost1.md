## Why do a blog?

A blog is useful for many reasons. It can help me, as a developer, learn much faster. A person can never fully understand a topic until they are able to explain it. It is also an opportunity for me to broaden my technology stack horizons and try new things. It is a medium to help share my ideas, my perspectives, and myself.

I am starting a blog for many reasons as I believe most developers have/should create a blog. Ideally when not sleep deprived, developers can gain a lot from starting a blog. It is a custom platform to communicate ideas to an audience while practicing your technical writing and clear documentation (something many developers struggle lol).

My main reason for doing a blog is really more for sharing with myself than really any particular group or audience. I found that writing things down helps me retain information better long term. And sure, the audience might learn a few things from your blog, but you are the one who will be the one most frequently revisiting your blog. So you are both the student and the teacher.

It is also a way to stay visible in a digital footprint customed by you. Don't have to rely on a social media platform that may or may not change their TOS or become obsolete in the future. By having my own blog, I have complete creative freedom of what goes in whether it is tech related or just simply lifestyle opinions.

And of course, it is a way to connect with others who are similarly interested in what you're writing about. Not simply as a form of networking for a job but just gaining/strengthening relationships with like-minded and passionate nerds. Gives more opportunity to gain different perspective and think more critically when given upon feedback.

Who knows if I will be consistent and continue this blog. My hope is that it will encourage me to be manage my time more with personal projects and give time to relax and reflect on tech just for fun.
